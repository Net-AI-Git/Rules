# Cursor Rules Documentation

This directory contains Cursor Rules - system-level instructions for the Cursor AI Agent. Rules define coding standards, architectural patterns, security requirements, and development workflows that guide the AI's behavior.

## What are Cursor Rules?

Cursor Rules provide system-level instructions to the Cursor AI Agent. They bundle prompts, scripts, and more together, making it easy to manage and share workflows across your team. Rules are stored in `.cursor/rules` and are version-controlled.

Rules are included at the start of the model context, giving the AI consistent guidance for generating code, interpreting edits, or helping with workflows.

## Directory Structure

Rules in this repository are organized by category:

```
.cursor/rules/
├── core/              # Always-applied core rules (Python standards, error handling)
├── security/          # Security and governance rules
├── agents/            # Agent-specific rules (multi-agent, LangGraph, agentic logic)
├── infrastructure/    # Deployment, monitoring, performance
├── development/       # Testing, code review, versioning
├── api/               # API-related rules
├── data/              # Data schemas, migrations
├── evaluation/        # LLM evaluation, judging, auditing
├── configuration/     # Configuration, dependency injection, prompts
├── rules-management/ # Meta-rule for managing rules
└── commands-management/ # Meta-rule for managing commands
```

### Rule Folder Structure

Each rule is a **folder** containing a `RULE.mdc` file:

```
.cursor/rules/
  category-name/
    rule-name/
      RULE.mdc
```

**Important:**
- Each rule must be in its own folder
- The folder name should be kebab-case (e.g., `core-python-standards`)
- The file inside must be named exactly `RULE.mdc` (capital letters, `.mdc` extension)

## Rule Types

Rules are applied automatically based on their type, defined in the YAML frontmatter at the start of each `RULE.mdc` file:

### 1. Always Apply

Applied to every chat session automatically.

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
alwaysApply: true
---
```

**Use when:** The rule should always be active (e.g., core coding standards, security requirements).

**Examples:**
- `core-python-standards` - Python coding standards
- `error-handling-and-resilience` - Error handling patterns
- `security-governance-and-observability` - Security standards
- `audit-protocol` - Audit procedures
- `final-review-protocol` - Final review process

### 2. Apply Intelligently

Applied when the Agent decides it's relevant based on the description.

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
description: "Clear description of what this rule covers"
alwaysApply: false
---
```

**Use when:** The rule is contextually relevant but not always needed (e.g., API documentation when working on APIs, multi-agent patterns when building agents).

**Examples:**
- `code-review-and-collaboration` - Code review standards
- `multi-agent-systems` - Multi-agent architecture patterns
- `contract-scope-and-boundaries` - When to define explicit API contracts
- `llm-judge-protocol` - LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation
- `performance-optimization` - Performance best practices

### 3. Apply to Specific Files

Applied when working on files that match the specified glob patterns.

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
globs: **/api/**/*.py, **/routes/**/*.py
alwaysApply: false
---
```

**Use when:** The rule is only relevant for specific file types or locations.

**Examples:**
- `api-documentation-standards` - Applied when working on API files
- `api-interface-and-streaming` - Applied when working on API routes
- `tests-and-validation` - Applied when working on test files
- `langgraph-architecture-and-nodes` - Applied when working on LangGraph nodes

### 4. Apply Manually

Applied only when explicitly mentioned in chat (e.g., `@rule-name`).

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
alwaysApply: false
---
```

**Use when:** The rule is rarely needed and should only be applied on demand (e.g., special audit protocols, meta-rules).

**Note:** Currently, no rules use this type. Meta-rules (`rules-management`, `commands-management`) use "Apply to Specific Files" instead.

## How Rules Are Applied

1. **Always Apply rules** are automatically included in every chat session
2. **Apply Intelligently rules** are considered by the Agent based on the conversation context and the rule's description
3. **Apply to Specific Files rules** are automatically included when you're working on files matching the glob patterns
4. **Apply Manually rules** are only included when you explicitly mention them (e.g., `@rule-name`)

The Agent combines relevant rules to provide comprehensive guidance for your specific task.

## Usage

### Copying Rules to Your Project

#### Option 1: Copy Everything
Copy the entire `.cursor/rules` folder to your project root. Cursor will automatically:
- Apply "Always Apply" rules to every session
- Apply "Apply to Specific Files" rules when working on matching files
- Consider "Apply Intelligently" rules based on context

#### Option 2: Copy by Category
Copy only the category folders you need:

**For all projects:**
- `core/` - Essential coding standards
- `security/` - Security and governance

**For agent projects:**
- `agents/` - Multi-agent patterns
- `evaluation/` - LLM evaluation

**For API projects:**
- `api/` - API design and documentation

**For production projects:**
- `infrastructure/` - Deployment and monitoring

### Rule Application Examples

**Example 1: Working on API code**
- `core-python-standards` (Always Apply) - Active
- `error-handling-and-resilience` (Always Apply) - Active
- `api-interface-and-streaming` (Apply to Specific Files) - Active (matches `**/api/**/*.py`)
- `api-documentation-standards` (Apply to Specific Files) - Active (matches `**/api/**/*.py`)

**Example 2: Working on test files**
- `core-python-standards` (Always Apply) - Active
- `error-handling-and-resilience` (Always Apply) - Active

- `multi-agent-systems` (Apply Intelligently) - Considered (relevant to conversation)
- `langgraph-architecture-and-nodes` (Apply to Specific Files) - Active (if working on node files)

## Creating and Updating Rules

When creating or updating Rules, follow the format defined in `.cursor/rules/rules-management/RULE.mdc`:

1. **Choose the appropriate category** folder
2. **Create the folder structure**: `category-name/rule-name/RULE.mdc`
3. **Write the frontmatter** based on the rule type:
   - Always Apply: `alwaysApply: true`
   - Apply Intelligently: `description: "..."` and `alwaysApply: false`
   - Apply to Specific Files: `globs: "pattern1, pattern2"` and `alwaysApply: false`
   - Apply Manually: `alwaysApply: false` (no description or globs)
4. **Write the rule content** following the structure and format guidelines
5. **Use helper files** for code examples (see `helper-files-guide`)

See `.cursor/rules/rules-management/RULE.mdc` for detailed format specifications and examples.

## Rule File Format

Every `RULE.mdc` file must follow this structure:

1. **Frontmatter** (YAML between `---` markers)
   - Defines rule type and application behavior
   - Must be at the very start of the file

2. **Rule Content** (Markdown)
   - Mandate/Overview section
   - Detailed guidelines and standards
   - Examples via `@examples_*.py` helper files (keep rules under 400 lines)

See `.cursor/rules/rules-management/RULE.mdc` for complete format specifications.

## Integration with Commands

Rules work together with Commands (`.cursor/commands/`) to provide comprehensive workflows:

- **Rules** define standards and patterns that guide the AI's behavior
- **Commands** define workflows that use these standards
- Commands reference Rules in their "Rules Applied" section
- The Agent automatically applies relevant Rules when executing Commands

For example, the `/testing/run-test-suite` command references `tests-and-validation` and `core-python-standards` rules. When you run the command, the Agent automatically applies these rules (if they match the rule type criteria).

## Best Practices

1. **Use Appropriate Rule Types**: Choose the right type based on when the rule should be active
2. **Keep Rules Focused**: Each rule should cover a specific domain or concern
3. **Use Clear Descriptions**: For "Apply Intelligently" rules, write clear, specific descriptions
4. **Use Specific Glob Patterns**: For "Apply to Specific Files" rules, use precise glob patterns
5. **Update Rules Regularly**: Keep rules updated as standards and requirements evolve
6. **Test Rule Application**: Verify that rules are applied correctly in different contexts
