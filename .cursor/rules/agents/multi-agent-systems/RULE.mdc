## Mandate
All agentic systems in this codebase are designed as **Multi-Agent Systems**. This document defines the standard architecture patterns and rules for orchestrating multiple agents.

## 1. Core Architecture Components

### Orchestrator (Planner)
* **Role:** Decompose user requests into sub-tasks and decide how many workers are needed.
* **When to Use:**
  * Task structure is not known in advance
  * High variability in task complexity
  * Need dynamic scaling (2-10+ sub-tasks)
* **Responsibilities:**
  * Parse user request
  * Create SECTIONS list
  * Attach structured fields per section
  * **MUST NOT:** Execute work or produce final output

**See:** `@examples_orchestration.py` for Orchestrator/Worker/Synthesizer architecture pattern.

### Worker Agents (Specialists)
* **Role:** Execute specialized sub-tasks.
* **Principle:** Specialization - each worker focuses on one domain.
* **Note:** Not every sub-task needs a full agent; sometimes a function/tool is sufficient.
* **Responsibilities:**
  * Read assigned SECTION
  * Execute specialized work
  * Write to designated output key
  * **MUST NOT:** Modify SECTIONS list or write to another worker's SECTION

### Synthesizer
* **Role:** Unify worker outputs into a single coherent final output.
* **When to Use:**
  * Need unified document/answer
  * Conflicts between outputs require resolution
* **Responsibilities:**
  * Read collected worker outputs
  * Merge into FINAL_OUTPUT
  * Resolve conflicts
  * **MUST NOT:** Create new tasks or call workers again

## 2. SECTIONS Pattern

### Definition
* **SECTIONS** are the mandatory unit of work in multi-agent systems.
* A SECTION is a task contract that defines exactly what one worker must produce.
* Each SECTION must be owned by exactly one worker and must not be shared for writing.

### SECTION Structure
A SECTION must contain:
* **Identifiers:** section_id, task_id
* **Scope:** What to produce
* **Inputs:** Required data
* **Constraints:** Limitations, rules
* **Expected Output Shape:** Schema definition

### Rules
* Workers must treat SECTION as the single source of truth for what they are responsible to generate.
* Each SECTION must be sent to one worker as `worker_state.section`.
* Workers may read shared context from `SHARED_STATE`, but they must operate only on their assigned SECTION.
* Workers must never modify the SECTIONS list.
* Workers must never write into another worker's SECTION.

**See:** `@examples_sections.py` for SECTIONS pattern implementation.

## 3. FAN-OUT / FAN-IN Patterns

### FAN-OUT (Task Distribution)
* **Implementation:** Map the SECTIONS list to workers.
* **Pattern:** Each SECTION → One Worker
* **State:** Each worker receives `worker_state.section` with its assigned SECTION.
* **Concurrency:** Independent tasks run in parallel.

### FAN-IN (Result Collection)
* **Implementation:** Collect worker outputs into a shared agreed key.
* **Pattern:** Each worker writes to its designated output key (e.g., `RESULTS`, `COMPLETED_MENU`).
* **Format:** List of per-section results.
* **Rule:** **Read Many, Write One**
  * Workers may read many shared keys
  * Each worker writes to exactly one output target
  * Output target is append-only
  * Two workers must never write to the same scalar key
  * Any shared collection must be append-only with per-section items

## 4. State Management

### Shared State
* **Purpose:** Common context for all agents (input, intermediate results, documentation, decisions).
* **Mandate:** Almost mandatory in complex systems; without it, you have separate chats, not a system.
* **Usage:** Read-only for workers (except designated write keys).
* **Aggregation:** Add agent summaries (e.g., `summary_for_supervisor`) to the `messages` list in Global State.

### Worker State
* **Purpose:** Store task-specific details for each worker without polluting shared state.
* **When to Use:**
  * Many workers running in parallel
  * Each worker has different payload
  * Want to avoid race conditions/logical conflicts
* **Structure:** `worker_state.section` contains the assigned SECTION.

### State Field Ownership
* **Rule:** Assign each state field to a single "owner" node to avoid accidental overwrites.
* **Benefit:** Makes tracing failures easy.

**See:** `@examples_state_management.py` for shared/worker state isolation patterns.

## 5. Core Control Roles

### ORCHESTRATOR
* **Responsibility:** Understand request and decompose into SECTIONS.
* **Decisions:** How many SECTIONS, what each SECTION contains.
* **MUST NOT:** Execute work or produce final output.

### ASSIGN WORKERS Node
* **Responsibility:** Execution dispatch only.
* **Action:** Read SECTIONS list and create FAN-OUT by sending each SECTION to a worker.
* **MUST NOT:** Analyze, evaluate, or modify the SECTIONS.

### SUPERVISOR (Optional)
* **Responsibility:** Decision-making between agents.
* **Actions:** Choose which agent acts, in what order, whether to continue or stop.
* **MUST NOT:** Decompose tasks or perform FAN-OUT.

## 6. Stability & Reliability Rules

### Iteration Limits
* **Mandate:** Hard iteration limit for any loop.
* **Rule:** Never allow infinite refinement.
* **Implementation:** Set `max_iterations` and enforce termination.

### Deterministic Control Flow
* **Rule:** Workflow must be deterministic in control flow.
* **Requirements:**
  * Explicit start point
  * Explicit end point
  * Explicit conditional routing decisions
* **State Updates:** Performed by graph orchestration layer, not by workers directly.

### Failure Handling
* **Partial Results:** If a worker fails, return partial result with clear section-level failures.
* **State Protection:** Do not corrupt shared state on worker failure.
* **Error Isolation:** Worker failures must not cascade to other workers.

### Fallback Agent
* **Purpose:** Ensure system doesn't crash when primary agents fail.
* **Implementation:** Implement fallback agent to handle failures gracefully.
* **See:** `error-handling-and-resilience.md` for comprehensive error handling patterns.

## 7. Performance Optimization

### Parallel Execution
* **Independent Tasks:** Independent tasks run in parallel, then unified.
* **Implementation:** Use `asyncio.gather()` or LangGraph's parallel execution.
* **Benefit:** Improved throughput and reduced latency.

### Throughput Mindset
* **Mandate:** Always think about throughput efficiency when writing code.
* **Considerations:**
  * Minimize sequential dependencies
  * Batch operations where possible
  * Cache expensive computations
  * Use connection pooling

* **See:** `performance-optimization.md` for comprehensive performance strategies.

## 8. GraphState Consultation

* **Rule:** Before choosing a GraphState structure, consult with the team.
* **Rationale:** State design is critical for multi-agent systems and affects all components.
* **Process:** Propose state structure, get approval, then implement.

* **See:** `langgraph-architecture-and-nodes.md` for state design guidelines.
