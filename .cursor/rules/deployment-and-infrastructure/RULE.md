## 1. CI/CD Pipeline Standards

* **Pipeline Stages:**
    * **Lint:** Run code linters (ruff, black, mypy).
    * **Test:** Run unit tests and integration tests.
    * **Build:** Build Docker images.
    * **Security Scan:** Scan for vulnerabilities (Snyk, Trivy).
    * **Deploy Staging:** Deploy to staging environment.
    * **E2E Tests:** Run end-to-end tests in staging.
    * **Deploy Production:** Deploy to production (manual approval required).

* **Mandate:** All code changes must pass through CI/CD pipeline. No direct production deployments.

* **Fast Feedback:** Fail fast on early stages (lint, test) to provide quick feedback to developers.

* **Parallel Execution:** Run independent stages in parallel to reduce pipeline duration.

* **Artifact Management:** Store build artifacts (Docker images, packages) in a registry with versioning.

## 2. Containerization (Docker Best Practices)

* **Multi-Stage Builds:** Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size.
    * **Build Stage:** Install build dependencies and compile code.
    * **Runtime Stage:** Copy only necessary files to minimal base image.

* **Base Images:**
    * **Use Official Images:** Prefer official Python images from Docker Hub.
    * **Pin Versions:** Pin specific image versions (e.g., `python:3.11-slim`) instead of `latest`.
    * **Minimal Images:** Use `-slim` or `-alpine` variants to reduce image size.

* **Layer Optimization:**
    * **Order Matters:** Copy dependency files (`requirements.txt`) before source code to leverage Docker cache.
    * **Combine RUN Commands:** Combine multiple `RUN` commands to reduce layers.
    * **Clean Up:** Remove package managers and cache in the same layer.

* **Security:**
    * **Non-Root User:** Run containers as non-root user.
    * **Secrets:** Never embed secrets in Docker images. Use environment variables or secret management.
    * **Scan Images:** Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities.

* **Example Structure:**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --user --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local
COPY . .
ENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH
USER 1000
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

## 3. Orchestration (Kubernetes Patterns)

* **Deployment Resources:**
    * **Replicas:** Configure appropriate replica count for high availability.
    * **Resource Limits:** Set CPU and memory limits and requests.
    * **Health Checks:** Configure liveness and readiness probes.

* **Service Discovery:**
    * **Service Resources:** Use Kubernetes Services for internal service discovery.
    * **DNS:** Services are accessible via DNS names (e.g., `service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local`).

* **ConfigMaps & Secrets:**
    * **ConfigMaps:** Store non-sensitive configuration.
    * **Secrets:** Store sensitive data (API keys, passwords). Use Kubernetes Secrets or external secret management.

* **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA):**
    * **Metrics:** Scale based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.
    * **Min/Max Replicas:** Define minimum and maximum replica counts.

* **Rolling Updates:**
    * **Strategy:** Use RollingUpdate strategy for zero-downtime deployments.
    * **Max Surge/Unavailable:** Configure how many pods can be created/terminated during updates.

## 4. Environment Promotion

* **Environment Hierarchy:**
    * **Development:** Local development and feature testing.
    * **Staging:** Pre-production environment matching production configuration.
    * **Production:** Live environment serving real users.

* **Promotion Process:**
    * **Automated Promotion:** Automatically promote to staging after successful CI/CD.
    * **Manual Approval:** Require manual approval for production deployments.
    * **Smoke Tests:** Run smoke tests after each promotion.

* **Configuration Management:**
    * **Environment-Specific Configs:** Use separate configuration files or environment variables per environment.
    * **No Hardcoding:** Never hardcode environment-specific values in code.

* **Database Migrations:**
    * **Run Migrations:** Execute database migrations as part of deployment process.
    * **Rollback Plan:** Have a rollback plan for failed migrations.

## 5. Blue-Green Deployments

* **Concept:** Maintain two identical production environments (blue and green).
    * **Active Environment:** One environment serves live traffic.
    * **Inactive Environment:** The other environment is updated with new version.

* **Deployment Process:**
    1. Deploy new version to inactive environment.
    2. Run health checks and smoke tests.
    3. Switch traffic from active to inactive environment.
    4. Monitor for issues.
    5. Keep previous environment as backup for quick rollback.

* **Benefits:**
    * **Zero Downtime:** No downtime during deployments.
    * **Quick Rollback:** Instant rollback by switching traffic back.
    * **Testing:** Test new version in production-like environment before switching.

* **Implementation:** Use load balancer or service mesh to route traffic between environments.

## 6. Rollback Procedures

* **Automated Rollback:**
    * **Health Check Failures:** Automatically rollback if health checks fail after deployment.
    * **Error Rate Threshold:** Rollback if error rate exceeds threshold.
    * **Latency Threshold:** Rollback if latency exceeds acceptable limits.

* **Manual Rollback:**
    * **Process:** Document clear rollback procedure.
    * **Access:** Ensure team has access to rollback tools and permissions.
    * **Communication:** Notify stakeholders before and after rollback.

* **Rollback Strategies:**
    * **Image Rollback:** Revert to previous Docker image version.
    * **Code Rollback:** Revert Git commit and redeploy.
    * **Database Rollback:** Rollback database migrations if needed (see `data-migration-and-compatibility.md`).

* **Post-Rollback:**
    * **Investigation:** Investigate root cause of deployment failure.
    * **Documentation:** Document the incident and lessons learned.
    * **Prevention:** Update processes to prevent similar issues.

## 7. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

* **Terraform:**
    * **State Management:** Use remote state (S3, Terraform Cloud) for team collaboration.
    * **Modules:** Create reusable modules for common infrastructure patterns.
    * **Versioning:** Version Terraform modules and pin provider versions.

* **Pulumi:**
    * **Language Support:** Use Python for infrastructure definitions (consistent with application code).
    * **Type Safety:** Leverage type checking for infrastructure code.

* **Best Practices:**
    * **Version Control:** Store IaC code in version control (Git).
    * **Review Process:** Require code review for infrastructure changes.
    * **Testing:** Test infrastructure changes in staging before production.
    * **Documentation:** Document infrastructure architecture and dependencies.

* **Resource Tagging:**
    * **Mandatory Tags:** Tag all resources with: environment, project, owner, cost-center.
    * **Automation:** Use tags for cost allocation and resource management.

## 8. Scaling Strategies

* **Horizontal Scaling:**
    * **Add Instances:** Scale by adding more instances/pods.
    * **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across instances using load balancer.
    * **Stateless Design:** Ensure application is stateless to enable horizontal scaling.

* **Vertical Scaling:**
    * **Increase Resources:** Scale by increasing CPU/memory of instances.
    * **Limitations:** Limited by instance size and cost.

* **Auto-Scaling:**
    * **Metrics-Based:** Scale based on CPU, memory, request rate, or custom metrics.
    * **Predictive Scaling:** Use predictive algorithms to scale before load increases.
    * **Scheduled Scaling:** Scale based on known patterns (e.g., business hours).

* **Database Scaling:**
    * **Read Replicas:** Use read replicas for read-heavy workloads.
    * **Sharding:** Partition data across multiple databases for write scaling.
    * **Connection Pooling:** Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.

* **Caching:**
    * **Application Cache:** Use in-memory cache (Redis) to reduce database load.
    * **CDN:** Use CDN for static assets and API responses when applicable.
