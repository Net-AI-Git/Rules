# Data Migration & Compatibility

## 1. Schema Migration Strategies

* **Migration Tools:**
    * **Alembic:** Use Alembic for SQLAlchemy-based applications.
    * **Flyway/Liquibase:** Use for non-Python applications or when Alembic is not suitable.
    * **Custom Scripts:** Use custom migration scripts for complex migrations.

* **Migration Best Practices:**
    * **Idempotent:** Make migrations idempotent (safe to run multiple times).
    * **Reversible:** Create reverse migrations for rollback capability.
    * **Atomic:** Ensure migrations are atomic (all-or-nothing).
    * **Tested:** Test migrations on staging before production.

* **Migration Types:**
    * **Additive:** Adding new columns, tables (low risk).
    * **Destructive:** Dropping columns, tables (high risk, requires careful planning).
    * **Data Transformations:** Transforming existing data (medium risk).

* **Migration Execution:**
    * **Automated:** Run migrations as part of deployment process.
    * **Manual Approval:** Require manual approval for destructive migrations.
    * **Rollback Plan:** Always have a rollback plan for migrations.

## 2. Backward Compatibility Guarantees

* **API Compatibility:**
    * **Versioning:** Use API versioning to manage breaking changes (see `api-documentation-standards.md`).
    * **Deprecation:** Deprecate old versions before removing them.
    * **Migration Period:** Provide migration period (e.g., 6 months) before removing deprecated versions.

* **Data Schema Compatibility:**
    * **Additive Changes:** Prefer additive changes (adding columns) over destructive changes.
    * **Optional Fields:** Make new fields optional to maintain backward compatibility.
    * **Default Values:** Provide default values for new required fields.

* **Code Compatibility:**
    * **Gradual Rollout:** Roll out changes gradually to detect compatibility issues.
    * **Feature Flags:** Use feature flags to control new functionality (see `versioning-and-release-management.md`).
    * **Monitoring:** Monitor for compatibility issues during rollout.

* **Client Compatibility:**
    * **Client Versions:** Track client versions and maintain compatibility with older versions.
    * **Graceful Degradation:** Provide graceful degradation for older clients.

## 3. Data Transformation Patterns

* **ETL Pattern (Extract, Transform, Load):**
    * **Extract:** Extract data from source.
    * **Transform:** Transform data to target format.
    * **Load:** Load transformed data to target.

* **In-Place Transformation:**
    * **Update in Place:** Update existing records in place.
    * **Batch Processing:** Process in batches to avoid locking issues.
    * **Validation:** Validate transformed data before committing.

* **Dual-Write Pattern:**
    * **Write to Both:** Write to both old and new formats during migration.
    * **Read from Old:** Read from old format until migration complete.
    * **Switch:** Switch to new format after migration verified.

* **Backfill Pattern:**
    * **Historical Data:** Backfill historical data to new format.
    * **Incremental:** Process data incrementally to avoid overwhelming system.
    * **Verification:** Verify backfilled data matches original data.

## 4. Zero-Downtime Migrations

* **Strategy:**
    * **Additive First:** Add new columns/tables before removing old ones.
    * **Dual-Write:** Write to both old and new formats.
    * **Gradual Migration:** Migrate data gradually (batch by batch).
    * **Switch Over:** Switch to new format after all data migrated.
    * **Cleanup:** Remove old columns/tables after switchover verified.

* **Example Flow:**
    1. Add new column (nullable).
    2. Update application to write to both old and new columns.
    3. Backfill existing data to new column.
    4. Update application to read from new column.
    5. Remove old column.

* **Rollback Plan:**
    * **Keep Old Format:** Keep old format until migration fully verified.
    * **Quick Switch:** Be able to quickly switch back to old format if issues arise.
    * **Monitoring:** Monitor for issues during and after migration.

* **Testing:**
    * **Staging:** Test migration on staging environment first.
    * **Load Testing:** Test migration under production-like load.
    * **Rollback Testing:** Test rollback procedure.

## 5. Versioning Data Structures

* **Schema Versioning:**
    * **Version Field:** Add version field to track schema version.
    * **Migration Tracking:** Track which migrations have been applied.
    * **Version Compatibility:** Maintain compatibility between versions.

* **Data Format Versioning:**
    * **Format Version:** Include format version in data structures.
    * **Upgrade Path:** Provide upgrade path for old formats.
    * **Deprecation:** Deprecate old formats before removing support.

* **API Data Versioning:**
    * **Request/Response Versions:** Version request and response formats.
    * **Transformation:** Transform between versions as needed.
    * **See:** `api-documentation-standards.md` for API versioning.

* **Storage Format Versioning:**
    * **File Formats:** Version file formats (e.g., configuration files, data exports).
    * **Upgrade Scripts:** Provide scripts to upgrade old formats.
    * **Backward Compatibility:** Support reading old formats.

## 6. Migration Rollback Procedures

* **Rollback Planning:**
    * **Before Migration:** Plan rollback procedure before starting migration.
    * **Test Rollback:** Test rollback procedure on staging.
    * **Documentation:** Document rollback steps clearly.

* **Rollback Strategies:**
    * **Reverse Migration:** Run reverse migration to undo changes.
    * **Data Restore:** Restore data from backup if migration corrupted data.
    * **Code Rollback:** Rollback code to previous version if migration is code-dependent.

* **Rollback Triggers:**
    * **Error Rate:** Rollback if error rate increases after migration.
    * **Data Corruption:** Rollback if data corruption detected.
    * **Performance Degradation:** Rollback if performance degrades significantly.

* **Post-Rollback:**
    * **Investigation:** Investigate root cause of migration failure.
    * **Fix:** Fix issues before retrying migration.
    * **Documentation:** Document lessons learned.

* **See:** `deployment-and-infrastructure.md` for general rollback procedures.

## 7. Migration Testing

* **Unit Testing:**
    * **Migration Scripts:** Test migration scripts in isolation.
    * **Reverse Migrations:** Test reverse migrations.
    * **Edge Cases:** Test edge cases (empty tables, null values, etc.).

* **Integration Testing:**
    * **Full Migration:** Test complete migration on test database.
    * **Data Integrity:** Verify data integrity after migration.
    * **Performance:** Test migration performance.
