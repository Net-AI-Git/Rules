## 2. Git Workflow

* **Branching Strategies:**
    * **Feature Branches:** Create feature branch from `main` for new features.
    * **Naming:** Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`, `fix/memory-leak`).
    * **Short-Lived:** Keep branches short-lived (merge within days, not weeks).

* **Trunk-Based Development:**
    * **Main Branch:** `main` branch is always deployable.
    * **Small PRs:** Prefer small, focused PRs over large changes.
    * **Frequent Merges:** Merge to `main` frequently to avoid conflicts.

* **GitFlow (Alternative):**
    * **Develop Branch:** Use `develop` branch for integration.
    * **Release Branches:** Create release branches for preparing releases.
    * **Hotfix Branches:** Create hotfix branches for urgent production fixes.

* **Branch Protection:**
    * **Main Branch:** Protect `main` branch (require PR, require approvals, require CI checks).
    * **No Direct Pushes:** Prevent direct pushes to protected branches.

## 3. Commit Message Standards

* **Conventional Commits Format:**
    * **Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
    * **Types:**
        * `feat`: New feature
        * `fix`: Bug fix
        * `docs`: Documentation changes
        * `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
        * `refactor`: Code refactoring
        * `test`: Test additions or changes
        * `chore`: Maintenance tasks
        * `perf`: Performance improvements

* **Commit Message Structure:**
    * **Subject Line:** Short, descriptive (50 characters or less).
    * **Body (optional):** Detailed explanation (wrap at 72 characters).
    * **Footer (optional):** Reference issues, breaking changes.

* **Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication support

Implement OAuth2 authentication flow with support for
Google and GitHub providers. Includes token refresh
and user profile retrieval.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(api): resolve memory leak in connection pooling

The connection pool was not properly releasing connections,
causing memory to accumulate over time. Added proper
cleanup in connection pool destructor.

Fixes #456
```

* **Mandate:** All commit messages must follow conventional commits format.

## 4. Branch Naming Conventions

* **Format:** `<type>/<description>`

* **Types:**
    * `feature/`: New features
    * `fix/`: Bug fixes
    * `hotfix/`: Urgent production fixes
    * `refactor/`: Code refactoring
    * `docs/`: Documentation updates
    * `test/`: Test additions or changes
    * `chore/`: Maintenance tasks

* **Description:**
    * **Lowercase:** Use lowercase letters.
    * **Hyphens:** Separate words with hyphens.
    * **Descriptive:** Be descriptive but concise.
    * **Examples:**
        * `feature/user-authentication`
        * `fix/memory-leak-connection-pool`
        * `hotfix/critical-security-patch`

* **Issue References:**
    * **Optional:** Include issue number in branch name (e.g., `feature/123-add-caching`).
